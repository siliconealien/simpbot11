Its primary purpose is to host Simp 4 Simp, a NSFW interactive text-based adventure game where you play a party guest at the Magnus Estate in 1824.\n\n**Will I get shot down if I try to seduce [x character]?  That doesn\'t sound like a good time to me :/**\nIf you try to seduce a character in the game, you will always succeed.  Also, the game is not points-based, so just explore however you see fit!  There are ways to die, though.  Because it\'s TMA.\n\n**Who\'s responsible for this?**\nThe bot was conceived and designed by siliconealien, and most of the dev work (or teaching Alien how to program) was done by itsthecheat.\n\n**Gameplay length varies depending on your options!**  The shortest route is 300+ words while the longest ones are around 2k.  __So we hope you will play again and not get discouraged if your playthrough is over quickly!__\n\n:eye: *Please follow @simpbot11 on Twitter!* :eye:\n\n-siliconealien (siliconealien#6767)\n-itsthecheat (whats_her_face#4335)')
