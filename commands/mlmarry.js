If you are honest and open with yourself, then you cannot deny how his words and demeanor speak to your unfortunate truth.  "What more is there to accept?" you ask rhetorically.  "After all, we come into this world alone, and we leave very much the same way."`\n\n`Mordechai\'s face lights up--that is to say, it fades to a slightly softer shade of grey.  He offers you his arm, and you shiver with cold as you take it.  You only feel more frozen as you press into his side.`\n\n`Congratulations, you spooky single, you!  You have snagged yourself a Lukas.  You are initiated into The Lonely accordingly, and the two of you wed that winter.`\n\n`The last human part of you to die considers having Jonah for a best man, but by that time you had already forgotten his face and name ...`\n\n`You live a long life at Mordechai\'s Moorland House in Kent, which should be beautiful, all things considered, but is exactly as romantic and attractive as dying of tuberculosis.  You raise Mordechai\'s children ... except for the ones he tears straight from your arms and sends away for being too sociable.  You always smell subtly of the sea.  And you spend a TON of Lukas family money.`\n\n`==========THE END==========`\n`* You chose to serve The Lonely`\n`* You married Mordechai Lukas, thus becoming obscenely wealthy`\n`* You\'re basically a tragic heroine in a gothic romance novel`\n`Not Bad. Probably Not Great, Either`
