He lets out a little squeak but offers no resistance, and in your impassioned state you all but slam him up against a wall.`\n\n`"What are you--," he starts to say.`\n\n`"You stay away from that man!!" you shout, your noses almost touching.  "I don\'t know what he is, but he is dangerous and I will *not* see you get killed!"`\n\n`Barnabas makes a bewildered little sound, you can feel the warm breath on your lips, and next thing you know your mouths are crashed together.  He tastes like spun sugar and iron, and you think your knees might give out when he moans softly into your mouth.  You feel him hardening against your hip, and you jam your thigh between his legs to let him rut while you work your way down his throat, leaving possessive purple bruises in your wake.`\n\n`This is how Jonah finds you.`
