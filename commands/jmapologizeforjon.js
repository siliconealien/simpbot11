He runs his hand up the nape of your neck.`\n\n`You giggle.  "Why, Mr. Magnus," you tease, "are you suggesting adding me to the collective?"`\n\n`Jonah grins wolfishly.  "I\'m suggesting I *may* have overreacted," he says with a playful eye roll.  "So what do you say?" he asks.  "Shall we chat a bit more, or should I call upon Dr. Fanshawe to rejoin us?"`\n\n`Anxiety must show on your face, for he adds, "I truly am more than amenable to either option."`
