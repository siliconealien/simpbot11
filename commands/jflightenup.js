"Thoughts colored as such by the darkness of these proceedings, my dear."`\n\n`"In that case," you respond cheekily, "we are glad to be a ray of sunshine to illuminate your way."  You shove Barnabas forward with your elbow, and he thwacks you playfully.`\n\n`Jonathan catches you off-guard with a laugh as warm a chocolate tone as his eyes.  You never would have expected him to be one capable of such a joyous sound.  "Indeed," says Jonathan, with a lopsided boyish grin, "I feel my path lighter for it already."`
