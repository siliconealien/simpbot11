"But I confess I was hoping to better get to know my fine host."Jonah laughs, looking at you fondly.  "Well, aren\'t you bold," he says.  You can feel his breath on your cheek.  "You\'re right, of course.  We have all night, you can meet the others later."  His hand trails from your shoulder to the small of your back, and you feel your cheeks burning up.  "What did you have in mind?"`
