`"Jonah," you sigh sadly, "you cannot ask me to invite such great evil into my heart, and I fear for you if you have already done so yourself."`\n\n`Jonah\'s jaw drops, and no words come out.  You get the sense that Jonah Magnus does not get told \'no\' very often.  It would be humorous, if not for the fact that you suddenly fear for your life.`\n\n`"I see," he says coldly.  "Pity.  Well, by all means, please enjoy the rest of your night.  Drink and dance as though it were sure to be your last."`\n\n`This unnerves you greatly, but you try to be a good guest nonetheless.  You almost do enjoy the rest of the party--until a sudden burst of fiery agony deep within your skull drops you to your knees, and then it all fades to black.`\n\n`You make an excellent new Head of the Magnus Institute, even if those who once knew you say that you feel like a stranger to them now.`\n\n`And they are sure your eyes never looked quite so green.`\n\n`==========GAME OVER==========`\n`You have been killed :(`\n`* You insulted Jonah Magnus by refusing his offer to serve The Eye`\n`* Your body now houses the consciousness of Jonah Magnus for spite reasons`\n`Better luck next time!`
