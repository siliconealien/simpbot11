His blue eyes widen adorably as Jonathan reaches for his hand, pressing a gentle kiss to the back of it before releasing him.  "It would appear I have had the good fortune to already meet everyone worth meeting at this party," Jonathan muses.  "What say we three take a walk about the grounds to get better acquainted?"`\n\n`Barnabas is glued to your side.

"Will you come explore with us?"`\n\n`* Select` :a: `to go for a walk with Barnabas and Jonathan.`\n`* Select` :b: `to insist on giving them privacy.`
