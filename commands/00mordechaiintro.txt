`"I must say," you intone a bit breathlessly, "that tall gentleman by the window exudes quite the presence."`\n\n`Jonah does a double take, shooting you a pointed look of surprise.  "Does he?" he asks.  "You are a rare sort for saying so.  Mordechai has a tendency to go ... unseen."`\n\n`It puzzles you how a man easily 6\'7" and so broad of shoulder might be invisible in a crowd.  As Jonah walks you to him, he whispers in your ear again, this time with a note of caution in his voice.  "I will leave you to get acquainted," he says, "but I shall not be far.  I would hate for you to ... disappear, with a Lukas, so early in the night."  You approach Mordechai Lukas, and after Jonah makes a basic introduction, he leaves the two of you alone.`\n\n`There is an uncomfortable silence while Mordechai appraises you, and you feel a chill down to your bones, as though a draft seemingly out of the blue.  "You\'re here alone," he says at last, approvingly, and a helpless sorrow settles down on you like a blanket of snow.`\n\n`"I am," you confess quietly, "as is often the case for me."`\n\n`Mordechai indulges you with something like a smile, but it does not reach his pale grey eyes.  "I see," he says.  "It is a powerful thing, to accept one\'s aloneness in a cold, uncaring world.  Tell me," he continues, "let us speak philosophy for a moment: What do you think of accepting *loneliness* as the purest state of the human condition?"`\n\n`* Select` :a: `to extol the beauty of loneliness.`\n`* Select` :b: `to try to get away from this awful man.`
