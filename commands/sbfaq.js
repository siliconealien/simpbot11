Its primary purpose is to host Simp 4 Simp, a NSFW interactive text-based adventure game where you play a party guest at the Magnus Estate in 1824.\n\n**Will I get shot down if I try to seduce [x character]?  That doesn\'t sound like a good time to me :/**\nIf you try to seduce a character in the game, you will always succeed.  Also, the game is not points-based, so just explore however you see fit!  There are ways to die, though.  Because it\'s TMA.\n\n**Who\'s responsible for this?**\nThe bot was conceived and the story was written by siliconealien (IneffableAlien on AO3), who also initiated and maintains the actual code.  Much of the dev work was done by either kaly666 or itsthecheat (GitHub users).\n\n*Special thanks to the Simp-bot Discord server for serving as beta testers!*\n\n**Gameplay length varies depending on your options!**  The shortest route is 300+ words while the longest ones are around 2k.  __So we hope you will play again and not get discouraged if your playthrough is over quickly!__\n\n:eye: *Please follow @simpbot11 on Twitter!* :eye:')
