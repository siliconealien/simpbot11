"I am simply fascinated by your work," you say, and you notice Jonah\'s eyes widen, his smile broadening with clear pride.  "It does not escape my curiosity that it was my statement which brought me here tonight."`\n\n`"Your instincts are commendable," Jonah breathes.  This feels like foreplay; he does not hide how thrilled he is by the subject.`\n\n`Over the course of the next hour, Jonah stuns you with a detailed explanation of the Entities, and how your statement--which involved a feeling of being watched--designates you as already having been marked by The Eye, his patron, which Watches over his Institute, as it is a bastion of terrible knowledge.  He says that he instantly recognized your statement as true.  Somehow, you believe him completely.`\n\n`Jonah gazes deeply into your eyes, his own an intense shade of green.  You feel *seen.*  "You\'ve made a distinct impression on me, my dear," he murmurs.  "I\'ve been developing a theory, one which would require me to take a partner at my Institute."  He pauses, stepping forward and grasping your hand.  His thumb rubs little circles into your palm, and you shudder with pleasure.  "Serve The Eye," he implores softly.  "Be my head archivist.  I am not sure yet what all that entails, but together we could live forever."`
