`You\'re about to make kind of a dick move, but Jonathan is a doctor, and he\'s really tall, so you figure it\'s time to ditch Barnabas.  "Splendid," you say with a smirk, "for if there\'s a path, I could use a guide."  You hold out your hand, and Jonathan\'s lips linger on the back of it as he watches you, expression unreadable.`\n\n`"Then let\'s take a walk, shall we?" he invites.`\n\n`"We will talk again soon, my dear," you tell Barnabas offhandedly as you prepare to leave him.`\n\n`"Oh, uh, all right then," says Barnabas meekly.`\n\n`You barely make it out into the hall before Jonathan ushers you into a dim alcove.  He presses against your front, gripping your ass as he walks you backwards toward a plush chair.  When your calves hit it, you sit without thinking, completely under the spell of his dominating aura.`\n\n`"So did you draw me out here to tease me?" he murmurs huskily.`\n\n`"No, sir," you mutter.  Your heart is pounding.`\n\n`Jonathan strokes your head, perfectly manicured nails scratching your scalp.  He places his foot on the chair beside you and drags your face to the front of his trousers.  He keeps you still as he rubs the ivory fabric around your nose.  "Ask for it," he says simply.`\n\n`Your mouth is watering.  "May I suck you off?" you gasp.`\n\n`Jonathan hums as he frees his cock.  "Only because you asked so nicely," he whispers.  He still doesn\'t release you as he paints your lips with beads of precum.  He finally loosens his grasp, and you take him into your mouth eagerly.  When at last he thrusts to spill his heat far past your throat, you moan around swallows.`\n\n`As Jonathan puts himself to rights, you feel eyes boring into you.`\n\n`It\'s not a great feeling.`\n\n`* Select` :a: `to continue the scene with Jonathan.`\n`* Select` :b: `to go get Barnabas in on this.`
