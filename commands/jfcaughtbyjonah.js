He lowers to his knees, ostensibly to return the favor, when Jonah appears in the hall.`\n\n`"Jonathan," he says.`\n\n`"Jonah," is Jonathan\'s reply, equally unhelpful.`\n\n`But when Jonah ducks his head and disappears around a corner, Jonathan goes to him without so much as another word.  Their long shadows stretch into view as they converse privately.`\n\n`Only Jonah returns, and you stand as he fast approaches.  You move away from the chair and take a step back as he inserts himself into your space aggressively.  "You know," he says, "one or the other I might have accepted with relative grace--but somehow you managed to both abandon Barnabas and steal away Jonathan under my roof."`\n\n`"You yourself have not exactly been a good host to Barnabas," you argue.`\n\n`Jonah\'s face almost touches yours, and you feel his breath on your lips when he laughs.  "Jonathan is not yours to take," he says, "and let\'s just say ... Barnabas is not yours to hurt."`\n\n`"Greedy thing, aren\'t you?" you murmur.`\n\n`Jonah stretches an arm past your shoulder and flattens his palm against the wall behind your head.  "I\'ve been called worse," he says smugly.`
