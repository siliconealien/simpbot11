Jonah has already instructed me that you are not for me."`\n\n`"Greetings, Mordechai," says Barnabas.  "I was wondering if I could interest you in a little gamble again tonight."`\n\n`While Mordechai and Barnabas chat, you feel a pair of arms twine about your waist, and you spin in sudden surprise to find Jonah embracing you.  It is shockingly intimate, the two of you drawn so close that your hips meet, and he places his hands on either side of your face.  "Lovely," he says quietly.  "I knew you were for me."`\n\n`"I don\'t understand," you mutter, your heart pounding.`\n\n`"Oh, I believe you do," he says.  "What do you think will happen to our sweet little lamb there, making bets with monsters?"`\n\n`"I\'m not sure," you admit.  "Something bad."`\n\n`"Almost certainly," Jonah says crisply.  "But you don\'t know what."  He pauses, brushing your hair off your forehead.  "Is that why you made no move to try and stop it?"`\n\n`You swallow.  There\'s no denying what you\'ve done.  You nod.  "I needed to know," you mumble.`\n\n`Jonah kisses you on the forehead.  "And that is nothing to be ashamed of," he says, pinning you in place with the sheer force behind his green eyes.  "You\'ve made a distinct impression on me, my dear," he murmurs.  "I\'ve been developing a theory, one which would require me to take a partner at my Institute."  He pauses.  "Come learn what it truly means to need to know," he implores softly.  "Be my head archivist.  I am not sure yet what all that entails, but together we could live forever."`
