OKAY I tried to make this make as much sense as possible but it will probably be a lot easier just to look at the individual text files because I also put the routes in there.  I just thought having a map couldn't hurt, too, and I'm about 90% certain I didn't miss anything in here.  It looks way more complicated than it is especially when you realize like with Fanshawe that it's almost the same thing over and over plus or minus a scene.  Basically as long as you start with s4splay and see that A goes to Mordechai and B goes to Jonah it should all explain itself in the text files from there.

00fanshaweintro => (a) jfquestionsstart => (a) jfdemandanswers (The Eye kills you)
00fanshaweintro => (a) jfquestionsstart => (b) jflightenup => (a) jfseduce => (a) jfcaughtbyjonah => (a) jmbalcony (you fall off a balcony)
00fanshaweintro => (a) jfquestionsstart => (b) jflightenup => (a) jfseduce => (a) jfcaughtbyjonah => (b) jmapologizeforjon => (a) 00jonahintro (redirects to Jonah)
00fanshaweintro => (a) jfquestionsstart => (b) jflightenup => (a) jfseduce => (a) jfcaughtbyjonah => (b) jmapologizeforjon => (b) jmmagshawe (you have a threesome with Jonah and Fanshawe)

00fanshaweintro => (a) jfquestionsstart => (b) jflightenup => (a) jfseduce => (b) jfmatchmaker => (a) jfbarnshawe (you have a threesome with Barnabas and Fanshawe)
00fanshaweintro => (a) jfquestionsstart => (b) jflightenup => (a) jfseduce => (b) jfmatchmaker => (b) jfgiveprivacy => (a) jmsupernatural => (a) jmarchivist (you become the Archivist)

00fanshaweintro => (a) jfquestionsstart => (b) jflightenup => (a) jfseduce => (b) jfmatchmaker => (b) jfgiveprivacy => (a) jmbalcony (you fall off a balcony)

The following are the same but you skip the seduction scene where you give Fanshawe a blow job:
00fanshaweintro => (a) jfquestionsstart => (b) jflightenup => (b) jfmatchmaker => (a) jfbarnshawe (you have a threesome with Barnabas and Fanshawe)
00fanshaweintro => (a) jfquestionsstart => (b) jflightenup => (b) jfmatchmaker => (b) jfgiveprivacy => (a) jmsupernatural => (a) jmarchivist (you become the Archivist)
00fanshaweintro => (a) jfquestionsstart => (b) jflightenup => (b) jfmatchmaker => (b) jfgiveprivacy => (a) jmsupernatural => (b) jmkillsyou (Jonah Magnus kills you)
00fanshaweintro => (a) jfquestionsstart => (b) jflightenup => (b) jfmatchmaker => (b) jfgiveprivacy => (a) jmbalcony (you fall off a balcony)

00fanshaweintro => (b) jflightenup ^^^
These paths are the same except that it is possible to skip jfquestionsstart entirely
