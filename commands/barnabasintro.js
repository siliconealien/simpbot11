"He certainly seems out of place here."`\n\n`"Ahh," Jonah says knowingly, with an uncharacteristically soft smile, "my Barnabas.  Yes, he is something of a lamb amidst the wolves tonight."  Jonah nudges you playfully.  "Perhaps you could be his shepherd."`\n\n`You tilt your head to conceal your pleased smile behind your glass of champagne, but you know Jonah sees it.  You are watching the pretty blush that is rising from under Barnabas\'s collar.  "Soft as a lamb, I see."`\n\n`"Come on," Jonah says, gentler now, "he could use a kind sort to make him feel more welcome."  He walks you over and introduces you, and it would be impossible for you to miss how Barnabas beams like sunshine the second he sees Jonah.  Jonah kisses his cheek, and whispers in his ear with a touch to his face before leaving him with you.`\n\n`Barnabas glances down, peering up at you from beneath long light lashes.  "Thank you, truly, for coming to talk to me," he says.  "Jonah does not always keep the friendliest company."`\n\n`At the other end of the long table where you stand, a dark and brooding gentleman is scowling into his drink.  He is exceptionally handsome, yet appears just as uncomfortable as Barnabas with most present company.`
