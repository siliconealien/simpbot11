And why do I feel like I\'m being watched, goddammit??"`\n\n`With that, you imagine every guest at the party has fallen silent and turned to look at you, judging you.  You know they haven\'t, but the press of eyes from some unknown source burns your skin.  You feel faint.  You realize Jonathan is shouting something, but you can no longer hear anything over the blood thrumming in your ears.  You have to go.  Barnabas tries to grab your arm, but you break loose, running through the gates of the estate into the woods.`\n\n`It remains a mystery what happened to you that night, but when they find you in the morning, the blood and viscera on your face from where you gouged out your eyes has been dried far longer than you\'ve been dead.`\n\n`==========GAME OVER==========`\n`You have been killed :(`\n`* You were unable to resist the call to ask dangerous questions`\n`* You were driven to madness as a result, either by The Eye or Jonah Magnus`\n`Better luck next time!`
