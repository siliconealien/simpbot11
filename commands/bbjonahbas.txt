`Jonah sinks into the plush couch across from you and pats the cushion next to his, and Barnabas and you waste not a moment in each straddling one of Jonah\'s thighs.  He spreads his legs to make room for you both, chuckling darkly as he wraps his arms tightly around your waists.`\n\n`You whimper as you rub your heat up and down his fine trousers.  Jonah kisses your temple, making shushing sounds into your hair.  "We have all the time in the world," he promises, then ducks his head to catch Barnabas\'s mouth with his.`\n\n`Jonah slides his tongue between your lips next, and you moan around it.  "I need," you say when he pulls back, "I need ..."`\n\n`"I know," Jonah purrs, "and you\'re going to get it."`\n\n`You never would have pegged (no pun intended) Barnabas for a top, but you scarcely see it coming when the two of them flip the script and drag you using your hair onto your back.  They position you perfectly for Barnabas to thrust inside you, clenched fingers grinding the bones of your ankles, while you gag on Jonah\'s cock too far down your throat.`\n\n`This is the start of a beautiful arrangement, and it is not long before the three of you more or less share the estate.  Jonah and Barnabas keep you collared and rarely clothed, and you do not mind at all.`\n\n`There are worse fates than ending up the pampered sex pet of a handsome intellectual Regency monster and his dandy husband.`\n\n`==========THE END==========`\n`Congratulations!`\n`* You saved Barnabas Bennett from The Lonely`\n`* You got double-teamed by Barnabas Bennett and Jonah Magnus`\n`* You moved into the Magnus Estate as Jonah and Barnabas\'s sex slave`\n`Great Job!`
