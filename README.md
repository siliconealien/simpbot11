# Simp-bot

Simp-bot is a Discord bot made by and for Magnus Archives fangirls and boys.  Or whatever you are ... just so long as you are specifically the type to read and write smutty Regency period fanfiction.

The bot is the host of Simp 4 Simp, an interactive text-based adventure game where you play a party guest at the Magnus Estate in 1824.

Will you seduce one of Jonah's historical simps?  Will you fall victim to Beholding and gouge out your eyes?  Are there catboys??  Invite the bot to your server and find out!

## Disclaimer

Simp-bot is meant as a transformative fanwork and we have zero intent to try to make money off it!!  He is a labor of love and if anything we are likelier to lose money maintaining him lol.  The characters belong entirely to Rusty Quill Ltd.  Thank you for letting us abuse them :)
